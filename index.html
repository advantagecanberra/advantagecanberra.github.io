    <h3>Sample of published work</h3>
    <p class="justified">
    Situated in a peaceful street lined with deciduous trees, this north facing, beautifully renovated gem 
    has excellent street appeal and offers spacious open plan living, integrated with well designed 
    outdoor entertaining areas.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      Neat native gardens enclose the rendered front courtyard wall. Smooth paving extends from the 
      front courtyard along the length of the driveway to the rear of the property. Stepping into the front 
      courtyard, you will appreciate the excellent design of this private outdoor living space. From the 
      paving two steps lead up to a deck, which wraps around the home on the north and east sides. A 
      shade sail provides shelter as do the trees in summer.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      A stylish front door opens to a spacious modernised open plan living area, featuring polished pine 
      flooring, downlighting and full length windows to the north aspect. The thoughtfully renovated 
      kitchen has good bench space, including a moveable island bench, many cupboards and a pantry. It is
      equipped with a stainless steel upright stove with gas hob and a new stainless steel Bosch 
      dishwasher. A large window lets in lots of light and offers a private outlook over the rear garden. 
      From the dining area a sliding glass door opens to the east facing deck, bathed in morning sunlight 
      and covered with a pergola, which cleverly extends over the paved driveway. The bright and spacious
      north facing lounge area has double glass doors which open onto the inviting front deck and 
      courtyard, creating a smooth flow of indoor to outdoor living. The deck is a standout feature of the 
      home and offers a scenic and private outlook to the native gardens and trees, a lovely space in which 
      to relax and entertain. The sheltered north aspect allows for enjoyment all year round and a healthy 
      kaffir lime flourishes alongside the deck.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      From the living area a glass panelled door leads to bedrooms and tastefully renovated bathroom. 
      This has a bath and shower, and separate w/c. The spacious master bedroom enjoys the north aspect
      and private outlook over the native gardens. It has a wall of built-in robes and an air conditioner. 
      Attractive, energy saving honeycomb blinds are fitted to bedrooms and living areas.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      An extensive paved area at the rear of the home offers more outdoor living and overlooks the 
      attractive rear garden, which has a number of fruit trees including lemon, fig and grapefruit and an 
      abundance of herbs, including mint, rosemary and sage. There is a fenced area at the back with a 
      small garden shed, which may lend itself to keeping a pet or chooks.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      The location, in a friendly neighbourhood, has all the charm of the inner north and streets sheltered 
      by a green canopy in summer. It is close to a children’s playground, many parks, Downer shops and 
      transport. The thriving Dickson centre is an enjoyable walk and many local schools are nearby.</p>
