      Enjoy blissful rural views from living and entertaining areas of this stunning modern home</p>
    <p class="justified">
      The flowing curves of this distinctive, architect designed contemporary home blend into the undulating
      landscape of its surrounding five acres of lush paddocks, dotted with old gum trees and dense groves of
      young eucalypts. The peaceful community is situated in a wine district producing some notable labels such
      as Clonakilla and Four Winds.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      The home has instant appeal. Curved sections of roof shelter bedroom wings on either side of the central
      living area and the attractive bagged finish has been freshly painted. A thriving group of established
      birch trees and pathway of pavers and pebbles complement the tastefully landscaped front garden.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      The beautiful light filled, open plan living area is the heart of the home and maximises the perfect
      north aspect with full length windows. The home has been freshly painted throughout in a cool white shade.
      The focal point of this stunning central living area is the vaulted ceiling, studded with LED downlighting.
      The apex runs from a high set triangular window at the front through to the pitched roof pergola at the
      rear, achieving a seamless integration of indoor with outdoor living.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      The sleek, brand new kitchen features a vast expanse of white Caesarstone benchtop, stylish herringbone
      patterned tiling and an island bench with breakfast bar. Quality stainless steel appliances include an
      Omega gas hob, Fisher and Paykel oven, rangehood and dishwasher. A large walk-in pantry and many cupboards
      complete this fabulous chef’s kitchen. Timber look-alike, ceramic floor tiles through the living areas
      complement the fully renovated, stylish ambience. New ducted reverse cycle air conditioning maintains
      comfort in all seasons.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      The covered rear deck has been cleverly designed, with two columns supporting steel beams allowing clear,
      uninterrupted views from living areas and deck over the picturesque rural scene. Stainless steel railing
      and yacht wire safely enclose the space. Bistro blinds have been fitted right around. A useful lock up
      store room is located at one end of the deck.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      The light and airy master bedroom is very spacious and takes in the outlook from full length windows.
      French doors lead onto an open area of deck. The room has a wall of built-in robes, ceiling fan and a
      luxuriously proportioned, bright ensuite. The adjacent bedroom has a north aspect, built-in robe and
      a novel circular window. The opposite wing of the home houses the two remaining bedrooms which overlook
      gardens and also have built-in robes. All bedrooms are large and feature new carpets in a modern shade.
      The main bathroom has a practical design with a bath and shower room, separate w/c and open vanity area.
      The oversized laundry has a large amount of storage.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      There is internal access to the garage, which has a store room. A separate steel double garage, with
      attached carport is situated nearby.</p>
    <p class="justified">
      Inspired design and recent renovations with the highest quality finishes make this a home with timeless
      appeal and a delight to live in. The quiet country lifestyle offers a welcome respite from the pressures
      of modern living.</p>
